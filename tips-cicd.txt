At first, in Github, the virtual environment is empty. To solve that we use the action checkout

The uses keyword tells the workflow to run a specific action. 
An action is a reusable piece of code, like a function. Actions can be defined in your repository in 
a separate file or you can use the ones available in public repositories.

After checking out, we configure node as it is the environment running the project.

In the deployment step to heroku, we have set up a healthcheck so that the same step ensures the app is app and running
Furthermore, if the app crashes, rollbackonhealthcheckfailed: true will rollback to the latest functional deployment
